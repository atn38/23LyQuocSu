Dear Guest(s),

Welcome to _An’s Home_, 23 Ly Quoc Su. We’re super glad to be hosting you on your trip to Hanoi. 

In our time hosting, we’ve really enjoyed renting this cozy house out to travelers like yourself. It’s a great base from which you can discover the charms of the Hanoi Old Quarter.

In this manual, you’ll find lots of useful information that we’ve compiled to help our guests make the most of their stay. From instructions on how to use the appliances to recommendations for nearby restaurants and shopping areas, we’ve got it all covered.

We hope that you enjoy the place as much as we did, and we hope you make many good memories here and in Hanoi.

<p style="text-align: right">
Have a great stay!</p>


<p style="text-align: right">
Sincerely,</p>


<p style="text-align: right">
The <em>A Rich Land</em> team</p>


**On names, currency, and units**

In Vietnamese, words have _diacritic marks_. You may recognize them as the little accents on top of regular Latin alphabet letters. We have chosen to write Vietnamese words without the diacritic marks, so that you can type them into Google easily. For example, the house address is _23 Lý Quốc Sư_ in full written Vietnamese, and in this manual we have written _23 Ly Quoc Su_. See the difference?

Example prices are given in USD. You may convert them into local currency using Google. Vietnam uses metric units. The air conditioning controls are in Celsius. 24 to 28 degrees Celsius is a comfortable room temperature range.

**HOW TO GET HERE**

The address is _23 Ly Quoc Su, Hang Trong, Hoan Kiem, Hanoi, Vietnam_. Feel free to use this address for the visa application to Vietnam. Once you arrive, look for wooden signs that say _An’s Home_ to locate the house. It is very, very close to the main street!

If you are arriving from Noibai International Airport, a trustworthy and affordable local taxi service from or to the airport can be booked in advance at the [taxinoibai.net](https://www.taxinoibai.net/) website. Their one-way rate is less than $15 USD and takes 40 minutes to an hour. We can help you arrange a ride if you message us the day before. If you are arriving after midnight it is wise to bofok transportation in advance: it is more difficult and more expensive to get a taxi at night. If you did not book anything, once at the airport, you can grab normal airport taxis or use a rideshare app (_Grab_ or _Gojek _are popular ones). We would not pay more than $25-30 USD for a one-way ride, anything more and you are likely getting ripped off. 

**CHECK-IN AND CHECK-OUT**

_Check-in is from 3:00 pm (three o’clock in the afternoon) and check-out is until 12:00 pm (noon). _We’d appreciate it if you could stick to these times. 

If you’d like to request an early check-in or a late check-out, please contact us through AirBnB/Booking/Agoda or the contact details provided at the end of this manual. However, we may not be able to grant your request if we have other reservations. 

**Check-in process**

Please let us know your arrival time as soon as you can. The cleaning lady, Ms. Hao, lives nearby. She or one of us will give you your keys. To comply with government regulations, we need to take copies of passports and Vietnamese visas for foreign travelers. You can provide copies beforehand, or we can take pictures at check-in.

**Check-out process**

If you can, please gather your dishes in the sink, and your trash in the trash can or in tied up bags on the first floor. Leave your keys on the coffee table before you leave.

**WIFI INTERNET DETAILS**

The wifi network is _Hai Nguyen_.

The password is _0916006868_.

**HOW TO USE APPLIANCES**

**Air conditioning**

Our air conditioning is a split ductless system. Each of the two bedrooms and the living room has its own separate unit. You can adjust the temperature using each room’s respective remote control. Please try and conserve energy: keep the temperature between 24 to 28 degrees Celsius, close windows and doors when the A/C is on, and turn the A/C off when you are not in the room or leave the house. 

**Kitchen**

The stove is induction. Basic pots, pans, bowls, cups, and utensils are provided. 

You can drink water from the silver water filter machine.

**Bathroom**

You can take warm showers by turning the hot water heater ten minutes before you plan to shower. The switch is located by the bathroom door. Please turn the hot water heater off when you are finished.

**Washer and dryer machines**

The washer and dryer are on the fourth floor rooftop. Detergent (powdered or liquid) may be provided in the vicinity. The machines are free to use. Please conserve energy by washing with cold water when possible and not drying for too long. As a bonus, this way your clothes will last longer and stay in better shape.

**LOCAL TRANSPORT INFORMATION**

**Around the neighborhood**

Walking is your best bet, most of the time. There is so much to do even within a 10-15 minute walk radius, you will probably never run out of things to see or places to eat/drink. Street crossing tip: on a narrow street, there is no need to find a crosswalk; walk slowly, hold out your arm, look both ways, look _confident_. 

**Within Hanoi**

A good option is the local rideshare apps, aka Uber or Lyft equivalents. _Grab _is the most popular, followed by _Gojek_. If you are by yourself and feeling adventurous, go with the motorbike option, it is cheaper: less than $5 USD to almost anywhere you’d want to go, and often just $1-2 USD. Cars cost a bit more, but most often still less than $10 USD one way. We recommend installing the app of your choice on a phone that will have internet access when you are out, and getting the app setup _before _you need it. However, if you are going from/to the airport, the rideshare apps will cost a little bit more compared to [taxinoibai.net](https://www.taxinoibai.net/), which you need to book at least a couple of hours in advance. 

The bus network is another option for the most adventurous and budget of travelers. Bus tickets are dirt cheap — less than half a dollar one way – no matter the distance. You pay in cash when you board the bus. Amazing value if you can find a direct route to where you want to go. It quickly becomes more hassle than it is worth if you need to transfer between buses. You can use Google Maps to figure out the stop you need and which route to take, or the [timbus.vn](http://timbus.vn/) website (they also have an app). Most buses will not announce your stop, or will announce it only in Vietnamese, so be aware. 

**Venturing outside Hanoi**

Many attractions are within day trip distance from Hanoi. Depending on your interests, booking a tour with a local travel agency can be very easy and often possible on short notice. Many travel agencies have physical offices around the Old Quarter; you will certainly notice their signs as you walk around. 



**PARKING**

Motorbikes: You can park your motorbike in front of the entrance, in the alley. Please bring your own lock. Most people traveling through Hanoi do not rent motorbikes, however, but rely on public transport or rideshare/taxi options. Please refer to the section on local transport information.

Cars: We do not recommend bringing or renting a car if you are exploring the Hanoi Old Quarter neighborhood. The area is very densely populated and parking can be expensive or hard to come by. 



**SIGHTS TO SEE / THINGS TO DO / WHERE TO EAT OR DRINK**

We have given below the names of the businesses as they appear in Google Maps, minus the Vietnamese diacritic marks. Try plugging the names in Google Maps to get precise directions.

**Local attractions / Things to do**

The main attraction of the neighborhood is _Hoan Kiem Lake_. Take a walk around the entire lake and take in the sights.

South of the house is the _St. Joseph’s Cathedral_. You can get admission to tour the inside, although it is sometimes closed due to construction. The surrounding area is a spot where young locals congregate to sit, have iced lemon tea (this is similar to an Arnold Palmer in America), and chat in good weather. 

_Mo Art Space_ down the street is an exhibition space where you can see work from contemporary Vietnamese artists. They are not always open; check their website [moart.vn](https://www.moart.vn/) or Instagram for what’s on display. _Manzi Art Space and Cafe_ is a bit further, and houses permanent art collections as well as revolving exhibitions. These are hubs for the local art scene.

_Hanoi Rock City_ by the Northern end of West Lake is a popular and intimate concert venue for local indie singers and bands. 

You can get a rickshaw tour of the Hanoi Old Quarter for about $15 USD an hour. The rickshaw driver we know doesn’t speak much English, but he is very enthusiastic. Message us to book a tour with him.

In general, we advise you to walk around, explore, see what’s happening. This is a neighborhood with rich history and remarkable architecture, but it does not feel static or “preserved”. People live here with their families, and it is the beating heart of the city still.

**Places to eat**

We would encourage you to be adventurous here. Walk around, try whatever catches your eye. With that said, here are several highly recommended local spots. Some are even famous.

On the same street, 1 minute walk from the door:



* _Pho 10 Ly Quoc Su_: beef pho noodles. We recommend the _tai _or _half done beef_ bowl. They have an English menu.
* _Quan Goc Da_: street snacks. Many variations on fried dumplings or spring rolls with savory dipping sauce. We recommend the _banh goi_ or _pillow cake_. They have an English menu.
* _Bun Mien Ngan Minh Thu_: rice or glass noodles with gander (a type of poultry, tastes similar to chicken). We recommend the glass noodles. They do _not _have an English menu, so order a bowl of _mien ngan_.

Within 10 minutes walk:



* _My Van Than Dinh Liet_: wonton noodles. This is a Chinese dish with a Vietnamese interpretation. Try and see if you can spot what’s different compared to more traditional Vietnamese noodle dishes. They have an English menu.
* _Bun Dau Co Tuyen Mam Tom Hang Khay_: brothless rice noodles with various proteins and a savory dipping sauce. Proteins include variations on sausages, fried tofu puffs, and stuffed intestines. You have two choices of dipping sauce, a fish sauce-based or shrimp paste-based one. The latter is more traditional, but _very, very_ pungent. Order at your own risk. 

**Coffee & Tea / Bars & Nightlife**

In Vietnam, coffee or tea is not a morning beverage to drink quickly on your way to work. It is an experience to savor and nurse a cup of strong coffee, to think and people-watch, or to linger and converse at the cafes on every corner. Do not go to Starbucks. Try these instead, in order of proximity to the house:



* _Do Cafe & Art_: one door down from the house. Chill vibes, filled with pieces from local artists. There is also an upstairs patio.
* _Blackbird Coffee - 5 Chan Cam_: popular modern space serving espresso and cold brew drinks.
* _Trung Nguyen Legend Cafe_: a famous Vietnamese chain of coffee roasters. Try their various coffee blends. 
* _An Cafe_: sidewalk seating, serves great _banh my_ sandwiches.

For a night out, walk northeast about 15 minutes to find the intersection between _Dao Duy Tu_ and _Ta Hien_ streets, the local nightlife area. _1900 Club Hanoi_ is a very popular club and bar. For a fancier option, _Terraço Sky Bar_ is a rooftop hotel bar with sweeping views of the entire lake.

For a quintessential Hanoi experience, pick up some beer from the cleaning lady Ms. Hao, sit on the plastic stools right outside the door, and chat late into the night with your companions. 

**Convenience stores**

The cleaning lady Ms. Hao, who may have given you your keys at check-in, lives nearby. She sells bottled water, beer, soft drinks, cigarettes, and a number of other handy things. 

You can find many local shop fronts selling everyday supplies. Look for a shop front with a glass cabinet displaying goods. For a more familiar convenience store experience, there are a couple Circle K locations within 10 minutes’ walk.
